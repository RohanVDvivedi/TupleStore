TASKS PICKED

* find out values for all multiplications and additions and ensure what maximum number can be placed on the page_size for no number to overflow a 32-bit unsigned integer, and add this number as a hard limit for the page_size ad maximum_tuple_size in README file

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
  * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
    * also support getting min and max values for given types
    * as soon as you implement type based comparators for the tuple store, the suffix truncation in bplus tree will break so fix that soon after that
