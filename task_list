TASKS PICKED
 
 * add function to zero out free space on the page
   * returns 1 only if there were any free space bytes on the page
   * very simple task for both slotted page and fixed array page
   * just call memory_set(page + get_offset_to_start_of_free_space, 0, get_offset_to_end_of_free_space - get_offset_to_start_of_free_space); for the corresponding page type

 * add logic for stream based hashing and hash value calculation, implement interface in Cutlery first, use it in TupleStore and implemnt a test hasher in TupleIndexer

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
  * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
    * also support getting min and max values for given types
    * as soon as you implement type based comparators for the tuple store, the suffix truncation in bplus tree will break so fix that soon after that
