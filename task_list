1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
  * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
    * also support getting min and max values for given types
    * as soon as you implement type based comparators for the tuple store, the suffix truncation in bplus tree will break so fix that soon after that
