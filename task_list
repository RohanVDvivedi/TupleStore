OPTIMIZATION TASKS FOR COMPUTATION
1*add total tuples size on page field
 *perfrom an inplace update when the external tuple is smaller than the existing tuple on the slotted page, this will reduce the requirement of compactions

FEATURE TASKS REDUCE SPACE USED ON PAGE
2* provide an option to use is_NON_NULL_field, to save ourselves from allocating a bit in the bitmap for the fields that can not be NULL.
 * provide a bit_offset_to_is_null_bit_in_is_null_bitmap value attribute to element_def, since now each element's bit can be at a different location in the is_null_bitmap
 * non_null fields when written to by NULL should fail

OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPRESSION TASKS
3* think how to do it (using a macro or a separate param to every function or just do it during compaction)
 * make provisions to reset the unused bytes to 0s on the page while performing init_page, run_page_compaction, deleting a tuple, updating a tuple and swaping the tuple. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page, run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined on a swap, update or delete.
  * this will avail better compression on the page
