1 PICKED TASKS
 *1* implement can_set_element_in_tuple, with additional parameter returning the final_tuple_size, and a return value suggesting if the element can be updated
 *1* update_element_in_place to update element in place, if the element is fixed sized or has smaller than or equal value size to existing element

 *2* compact serializable form of tuple_def and tuple_def_summary, to be stored in WAL or passed over network, and functions to serialize and deserialize it.

2 NEW TYPE TASKS
 *3* add long double (*think about it again, as long double does not have a ieee standardized format)
 *4* bit fields, having fixed number of bits (upto 64)
 *4* bitmap field
     * pack multiple adjacent bit fields and multiple bitmap fields together, or some way to do it, minimizing space usage
 *5* variable length signed and unsigned integer (like that of leveldb and sqlite) (see you GMP (GNU MP) can be used here)
 *5* variable length real numbers (see how GMP (GNU MP) can be used here)
 *6* nested_tuple datatype
 *6* arrays of types

3 OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPRESSION TASKS
 *7* make provisions to reset the unused bytes to 0s on the page while performing init_page, run_page_compaction. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page and run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined.
