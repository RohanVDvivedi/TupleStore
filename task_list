 * optimize variable sized tuple -> in accessing their size, element offsets and element sizes, pre calculate their element_offsets using a function, and pass then arround OR store offsets of elements before storing the elements, current algorithm is O(n^2)
 * for SLOTTED_PAGE store tuple_size with the tuple offsets, this decreases time required to calculate the space_occupied by tuples and all calls to get_tuple_size can be saved
 * add an is_null bitmap for both the tuple layouts FIXED and VARIABLE_SIZED
