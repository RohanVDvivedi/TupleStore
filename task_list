TASKS PICKED

 * add logic for stream based hashing and hash value calculation, implement interface in Cutlery first, use it in TupleStore and implemnt a test hasher in TupleIndexer

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
  * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
    * also support getting min and max values for given types
    * as soon as you implement type based comparators for the tuple store, the suffix truncation in bplus tree will break so fix that soon after that

2 OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPRESSION TASKS
 *2* make provisions to reset the unused bytes (bytes in free space) to 0s on the page while performing init_page and run_page_compaction.
   * very simple task for both slotted page and fixed array page
     * just call memory_set(page + get_offset_to_start_of_free_space, 0, get_offset_to_end_of_free_space - get_offset_to_start_of_free_space);
     * then test everything from tuple store to tuple indexer and also mini transaction engine
