1 PICKED TASKS
 *0* implement get_space_required_for_tuple_on_page -> the tuple passed must not exist on the page
   * use this function to compute a check to see if the tuple can be on the page
   * refactore all instances of get_tuple_size -> as they would occur with such calls
 *1* compact serializable form of tuple_def and tuple_def_summary, to be stored in WAL or passed over network, and functions to serialize and deserialize it.

2 NEW TYPE TASKS
 *2* nested_tuple datatype
   *2* add decimal fixed precission data type (* like libdecnumber) - implemented using nested_tuple datatype
   *2* nested_tuple data type takes input comparator
   *2* always stored like var length datatype regardless of whether it is fixed length or variable length tuple
 *3* arrays of types

3 OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPRESSION TASKS
 *4* make provisions to reset the unused bytes to 0s on the page while performing init_page and run_page_compaction. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page and run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined.
