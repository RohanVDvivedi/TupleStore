TASKS PICKED

 * pass call back when deleting soemthing attempts to delete something with is_static is true, this must be with call back context
 * refactor downstream apis when deleting the dtis, all libraries, grep the users of this library
 * clone for dtis, handle returning same pointer when static, and calling the callback also

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
  * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
    * also support getting min and max values for given types
    * as soon as you implement type based comparators for the tuple store, the suffix truncation in bplus tree will break so fix that soon after that

 * now large_uint and large_int are comparable to double and float by converting them into doubles, this is not exact and could be error prone but this is the best we can do
 * discard can compare and can typecast functions to always return 1 for all primitive numeral types
