 * preserve index of inserted tuples and allow moving arround the tuples by just swapping their indices
   * allow deleted tuples to hold their tomb stones, like in FIXED_ARRAY_PAGES, i.e. index of tuples are preserved and they do not change when the element is deleted
   * use end_of_free_space in the page header to mark the last allocation for a page
   * updates cause insert and move operation, i.e. true updates just like the FIXED_ARRAY_PAGES.
   * reinsert_compaction only to modify the slotted page models.
   * implement slotted page as if it is a stack allocator


 * dynamic programming approach to calculate offsets in a variable sized tuple
