1* think how to do it (using a macro or a separate param to every function or just do it during compaction)
 * make provisions to reset the unused bytes to 0s on the page while performing init_page, run_page_compaction, deleting a tuple, updating a tuple and swaping the tuple. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page, run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined on a swap, update or delete.
  * this will avail better compression on the page

2* implement it in a separate branch, since we need to test compatibility
 * provide an option to use is_NON_NULL_field, to save ourselves from allocating a bit in the bitmap for the fields that can not be NULL.
 * provide a bit_offset_to_is_null_bit_in_is_null_bitmap value attribute to element_def, since now each element's bit can be at a different location in the is_null_bitmap
 * non_null fields when written to by NULL are just set to 0

3* update read_value_from_page and write_value_to_page fuinctions to perform a memcpy when the access is unaligned
  * unaligned access won't work on arm computers
 * also allow 3 byte unsigned integers to be stored on the pages, this will help us save space
