TASKS PICKED

  * soon after tuple indexer is merged with new nested access api changes, replace with a more descriptive function to print user values

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
  * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
    * also support getting min and max values for given types
    * as soon as you implement type based comparators for the tuple store, the suffix truncation in bplus tree will break so fix that soon after that
  * add logic for stream based hashing and hash value calculation

 *2* compact serializable form of tuple_def and tuple_size_def, to be stored in WAL or passed over network, and functions to serialize and deserialize it, use Cutlery streams after it has been implemented/moved to Cutlery.

2 OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPRESSION TASKS
 *3* make provisions to reset the unused bytes to 0s on the page while performing init_page and run_page_compaction. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page and run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined.
