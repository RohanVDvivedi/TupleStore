 * formalize datatypes
 * use global hashmap to identify them each
 * use this hashmap to reference fuctions to each of them
 * move to slotted page model permanently (ditch the fixed tuple length model)

 * in a separate repo build Btree and SST persistent datastructures using SimpleTupleStorageModel and BufferPool libraries
