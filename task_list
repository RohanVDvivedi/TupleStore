TASKS PICKED

 * add function to compare user values in a list/array given their same or different dtis for 2 arrays of user values
  * compare_user_values(dti, uval1, uval2)
  * compare_user_values(dti[], uval1[], uval2[])
 * use this to optimize sorter using caching of user values

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
  * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
    * also support getting min and max values for given types
    * as soon as you implement type based comparators for the tuple store, the suffix truncation in bplus tree will break so fix that soon after that
