TASKS PICKED

 * creation of every tuple_def finalizes its type_info, initializes its size_def, implement constructor from only the data_type_info
 * tuple_size_def has 2 major fiunctions get_size and is_variable_sized -> there is also a possibility to implement initialize_minimal_tuple using size_def, so implement that aswell
 * constructors to construct tuple_size_def directly using size for fixed size, variable size using min_size, max_size and has_size_in_prefix AND containee data type info
 * nested get, set, hash, compare, expand, and discard functions with positional_accessor, taking in tuple_def and tuple as input using positional accessor

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
 * default compare and hash functions for user_value
 * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
 * only tuples can be stored on the disk, and each tuple has a corresponding tuple_def, and each tuple_def contains a tuple_size_def

 *2* compact serializable form of tuple_def and tuple_size_def, to be stored in WAL or passed over network, and functions to serialize and deserialize it, use Cutlery streams after it has been implemented/moved to Cutlery.

2 OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPRESSION TASKS
 *3* make provisions to reset the unused bytes to 0s on the page while performing init_page and run_page_compaction. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page and run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined.
