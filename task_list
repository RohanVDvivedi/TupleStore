TASKS PICKED

 * make get_data_position_info_for_containee_of_container take a cached value and return that only if it is invalid


 * future optimization
 * about 400 milliseconds can be shaved off from processing 1 million tuples, if the get_value_size_on_page(uint32_t page_size) is made constant to 4
 * think about instead passing it as parameter or something

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
  * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
    * also support getting min and max values for given types
    * as soon as you implement type based comparators for the tuple store, the suffix truncation in bplus tree will break so fix that soon after that
