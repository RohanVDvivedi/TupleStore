 * array of page_ids as indirections (* very important, this would allow us to build ondisk data structures like btree index and hash index)

 * dynamic programming approach to calculate offsets in a varibale sized tuple

 * in a separate repo build Btree and SST persistent datastructures using SimpleTupleStorageModel and BufferPool libraries
