TOP PICKED
 * add fixed length BIT_FIELD type (max bits 64) - a unsigned int bit field that is NULLable aswell
 * club adjacent bit field into a single bit field, use start bit_offset (== 0 for all elements other than bit_fields) and bit_field_size as bit_field specific attributed in element def.
 * all adjacent bit fields have same byte_offset and same size.
 * use cutlery's bitmap field to read and write bit fields from tuple
 * behave like uint64s
 * extra care while finalizing the tuple_def to club all the bit fields
 * print bit fields in binary uint64s

 * test with 6 + 4 + 7 size adjacent bit fields, taking 3 bytes

1 PICKED TASKS
 *1* compact serializable form of tuple_def and tuple_def_summary, to be stored in WAL or passed over network, and functions to serialize and deserialize it.

2 NEW TYPE TASKS
 *2* add decimal fixed precission data type (* like libdecnumber) - very useful for finanacial purposes
 *3* variable length signed and unsigned integer (like that of leveldb and sqlite) (see if GMP (GNU MP) can be used here)
 *3* variable length real numbers (see how GMP (GNU MP) can be used here)
 *4* nested_tuple datatype
 *4* arrays of types

3 OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPRESSION TASKS
 *5* make provisions to reset the unused bytes to 0s on the page while performing init_page and run_page_compaction. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page and run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined.
