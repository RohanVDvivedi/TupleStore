TASKS PICKED

 *2*
  * LARGE_INT
    * thorough review for primitive_numeral_types.c, data_type_info.h, data_type_info.c, data_type_info_defaults.h, data_type_info_defaults.c, user_value.c and user_value.h
    * check diff and review
    * test
    * merge to master

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
  * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
    * also support getting min and max values for given types
    * as soon as you implement type based comparators for the tuple store, the suffix truncation in bplus tree will break so fix that soon after that

 * now large_uint and large_int are comparable to double and float by converting them into doubles, this is not exact and could be error prone but this is the best we can do
 * discard can compare and can typecast functions to always return 1 for all primitive numeral types
