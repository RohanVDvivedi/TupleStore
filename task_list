1 NEW TYPE TASKS
 *1* implement functions for type_info, and define static types, of all possible default types, and macros to initialize sized fixed length strings, blobs and arrays
   * allow appending and inserting in middle, and discarding elements for variable element count: string, blob and array
   * add a hashmap for the system where types can be added,
   * add their function pointers for compare and hash
   * add logic to get, set, set_NULL -> for all and append, insert, discard, contains for only data containers
   * minor change to use is_valid_bitmap, instead of setting all null bits to 1, set valid bits to 1
   * implement logic to send a variable length element to the end of the tuple, use cutlery's left_rotate functionality
     * to move the variable length element to the end just perform memory_left_rotate(tuple + offset, tuple_size - offset, total size of variable length element_size)
     * we can do the same for making space for the appends and insert
     * add logic to add or substract all byte offsets by a specified value, if they are greater than a particular value

*2* after this each tuple has a non-nullable bit, now for a fixed length tuple, if a non-nullable bit is set, then make a new page layout.
  * that does not have a bit map stored for the is_valid bits, and has neither tuple_count nor the tomb_stone_count
  * it will only have page_header and array of fixed length non-nullable tuples
  * you will not be allowed to append, insert, or discard tuples they all fail, their cn_append, can_insert and discard_all/discard trailing tomb_stones counterparts return 0
  * you can still get_nth_tuple, update_tuple and update_inplace_element, but can never update tuples to NULL
  * get_tuple_count will always return the max tuple count on the page
  * exists tuple on tha page, will return 1, if it is without bounds
  * implement space query functions accordingly
  * such a page can be used to build bitmap pages/indexes, and interior pages of page_table and array_table, bitmap pages for page allocation bitmaps

 *3* compact serializable form of tuple_def and tuple_def_summary, to be stored in WAL or passed over network, and functions to serialize and deserialize it, use Cutlery streams after it has been implemented/moved to Cutlery.

2 OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPRESSION TASKS
 *4* make provisions to reset the unused bytes to 0s on the page while performing init_page and run_page_compaction. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page and run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined.
