TASKS PICKED

 * utility function to check if the data_type_info are identical
   * refactor set_element_in_tuple_from_tuple and compare functions everywhere to use this logic to check logical equality of data_type_info
 * serialization/deserialization functions for
   * tuple_size_def
   * data_type_info
 * add logic for stream based hashing and hash value calculation, implement interface in Cutlery first, use it in TupleStore and implemnt a test hasher in TupleIndexer

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
  * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
    * also support getting min and max values for given types
    * as soon as you implement type based comparators for the tuple store, the suffix truncation in bplus tree will break so fix that soon after that

2 OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPRESSION TASKS
 *2* make provisions to reset the unused bytes to 0s on the page while performing init_page and run_page_compaction. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page and run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined.
