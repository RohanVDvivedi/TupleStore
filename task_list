TASKS PICKED

 * optimize out multiple reads to offsets, get_pointer and get_user_value can be checked for null value, no need to call is_null_containee_in_container

 * future optimization
 * about 400 milliseconds can be shaved off from processing 1 million tuples, if the get_value_size_on_page(uint32_t page_size) is made constant to 4
 * think about instead passing it as parameter or something

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
  * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
    * also support getting min and max values for given types
    * as soon as you implement type based comparators for the tuple store, the suffix truncation in bplus tree will break so fix that soon after that
