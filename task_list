 * formalize test_cases
 	* initialize tuple function
 	* row build in a tuple_cache area
 	* use acro to switch between SLOTTED_PAGE_LAYOUT and FIXED_ARRAY_PAGE_LAYOUT
 
 * array of page_ids as indirections (* very important, this would allow us to build ondisk data structures like btree index and hash index)

 * in a separate repo build Btree and SST persistent datastructures using SimpleTupleStorageModel and BufferPool libraries
