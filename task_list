 * make provisions to reset the unused bytes on the page while performing init_page, run_page_compaction, deleting a tuple, updating a tuple and swaping the tuple. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page, run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined on a swap, update or delete.
  * this will avail better compression on the page

 * memset 0 when the fixed length field gets set to NULL
 * memset 0 all the bytes at the end of the variable length tuple when the field is set to NULL

 * provide an option to use is_NON_NULL_field, to save our selves from allocating a bit in the bitmap for the fields that can not be NULL
 * non_null fields when written to by NULL are just set to 0
