TASKS PICKED

 * can compare using data_type_info, compare using user_value using data OR user_value
   * if both are primitive numeral type elements compare them directly
   * if they are tuples they are comparable only if they both have same dti pointers
   * else lastly their containee type_info must match
 * test and make the old testcases function and return the same output
 * add new test case to test all functions of complex nested types using tuple def
 * test hashing using data_type_info and a pointer and data_type_info and user value, and make sure that the results are same

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1*
 * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
 * only tuples can be stored on the disk, and each tuple has a corresponding tuple_def, and each tuple_def contains a tuple_size_def

 *2* compact serializable form of tuple_def and tuple_size_def, to be stored in WAL or passed over network, and functions to serialize and deserialize it, use Cutlery streams after it has been implemented/moved to Cutlery.

2 OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPRESSION TASKS
 *3* make provisions to reset the unused bytes to 0s on the page while performing init_page and run_page_compaction. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page and run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined.
