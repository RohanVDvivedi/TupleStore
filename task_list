TOP PICKED
 * write testcases for test2

1 PICKED TASKS
 *1* compact serializable form of tuple_def and tuple_def_summary, to be stored in WAL or passed over network, and functions to serialize and deserialize it.

2 NEW TYPE TASKS
 *2* add decimal fixed precission data type (* like libdecnumber) - very useful for finanacial purposes
 *3* variable length signed and unsigned integer (like that of leveldb and sqlite) (see if GMP (GNU MP) can be used here)
 *3* variable length real numbers (see how GMP (GNU MP) can be used here)
 *4* nested_tuple datatype
 *4* arrays of types

3 OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPRESSION TASKS
 *5* make provisions to reset the unused bytes to 0s on the page while performing init_page and run_page_compaction. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page and run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined.
