TASKS PICKED

 * add new test case to test all functions of complex nested types using tuple def

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

 *1* add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing

 *2* compact serializable form of tuple_def and tuple_size_def, to be stored in WAL or passed over network, and functions to serialize and deserialize it, use Cutlery streams after it has been implemented/moved to Cutlery.

2 OPTIMIZATION FOR COMPRESSION TASKS
 *3* make provisions to reset the unused bytes to 0s on the page while performing init_page and run_page_compaction. The reseting of bits should happen always on init_page and run_page_compaction. and should happen if a macro is defined.
