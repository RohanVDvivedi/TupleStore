TASKS PICKED

 * need a function in tuple_def to get the size of a tuple from reading the prefix of object into a stream
    api something like uin32_t get_tuple_size_from_stream_using_tuple_def(tuple_def* tpl_d, void* buffer, uint32_t* buffer_size, void* context, uint32_t read_from_stream(void* context_p, void* data, uint32_t data_size));
    uin32_t get_tuple_size_from_stream_using_tuple_size_def(tuple_def* tpl_d, void* buffer, uint32_t* buffer_size, void* context_p, uint32_t read_from_stream(void* context_p, void* data, uint32_t data_size));
    here the buffer must atleast be 4 bytes long and buffer_size will be set to the number of bytes read from the stream, no bytes will be read from a fixed length tuple_def

1 NEW TYPE TASKS

  * compare strings based on utf8 encoding
   * need cutlery util for this (dependency yet to be fulfilled)

 *1*
  * add hash_tables for type_name based type casting, comparing and hashing
    * also support getting min and max values for given types
    * as soon as you implement type based comparators for the tuple store, the suffix truncation in bplus tree will break so fix that soon after that
