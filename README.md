# SimpleTupleStorageModel

This library provides you with a very simple 
 * **row oriented - slotted page & fixed array page storage models,**
 * **for fixed or variable length predefined tuples,**
 * **to be stored on fixed sized pages for block storage systems.**

Started as a project to be used for managing page layout in a database storage engine.

To reiterate : This project is not a database, embedded database, database storage engine or any of that.
It only provides primitive utility functions/structures to systematically organize your data in tuples of predefined datatypes in a specific (slotted page or fixed array page) model for a block storage memory consisting of pages of predefined fixed size.
