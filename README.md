# SimpleTupleStorageModel

This library provides you with a very simple 
 * **row oriented - slotted page storage model,**
 * **fixed length predefined tuples,**
 * **to be stored on fixed sized pages for block storage systems.**

Started as a project to be used in a small database storage engine.

To reiterate : This project is not a database, embedded database, database storage engine or any of that.
It only provides primitive utility functions to systematically organize your data in a specific model for a block storage memory.

setup instructions
 * cd SimpleTupleStorageModel
